# MAGD-150-Assignments
The First Project I ever made was a project about buildings. It was in all greyscale and I thought it looked pretty symetrical. I had the unique idea to have circles make the windows on the central building.

The Second Project listed is themed around space and my first introduction to color. I created a starship that seems to be going into hyperdrive and what I thought were a pair of little galaxies.

The Third Project listed is supposed to be a unique loading screen. I had the idea to make the scale of purple to maroone. It looks very ellegant and pleasing to the eye.

The Fourth Project is pizza themed. The circles in the center create a loop that slows down or speeds up depending on where the mouse is located. Also there is the key implementation of Q where if pressed a pizza shows up. When the mouse is pressed there is a new slide to be created.

The Fifth Project is television themed. I had the creative idea to have channels on the tv. After messing around wtih the commands and booleans I managed to get four channels to work. Also if you press a key a little fun interaction happens.
